Blogger gadget for subscriptions on MailUp

Visitors to your Blogger-powered blog or Web site will be able to subscribe to your newsletter using a configurable sign-up form that is connected to your MailUp admin console.

The MailUp plugin supports the recommended 'confirmed opt-in' subscription method (i.e. subscriber receives an email with a confirmation link that has to be clicked to confirm the subscription). This method ensures that spam traps or wrong email addresses are never added to your list. The unsubscription process will be managed automatically by MailUp (e.g. unsubscribe link in the footer of your messages).

MailUp supports SMS (text messaging) too, so you can choose to collect a mobile phone number as well.


You can add a configure a gadget in one of the following ways:
1) Install the gadget that is hosted by blogger.mailup.com
2) Download, customize and host the source code that is contained in mailup-blogger repository (GitHub)
